# 🔥 Attention!!

**Currently, .NET MAUI is in preview, and setting up the environment for the .NET MAUI is quite tricky and challenging. So if you would like to ignore/skip .NET MAUI for now then, simply remove the `MauiBlazorApp` and `MauiBlazorApp.WinUI` projects from the solution and build the solution. Now everything should work fine!**
